Monichromitor
=============

README
------

Monichromitor is a **Processing** sketch plus a **PureData** patch we have created to simulate a computer automatically writing on a monochrome monitor.


USAGE
-----
In order to use this two programs you need **Processing** and **PureData Extended** up and running: you can download them respectively from the [Processing](https://www.processing.org/) website and from the [PureData](http://puredata.info/) website.

Processing and PureData needs to communicate via OSC protocol in order to reproduce sounds: to do this the Processing sketch is using the great [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/) library by **Andreas Schlegel** while the PureData patch is using the **mrpeach** library by **Martin Peach**, already included in PureData Extended version.

See the Monichromitor **User Manual** for more details.
